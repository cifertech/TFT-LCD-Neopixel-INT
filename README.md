# TFT-LCD-Neopixel-INT

Smarter and easier control of neopixels has always been interesting and challenging. In the past, I published tutorials that we used to control ws2812 neopixels in different ways, such as controlling these powerful and interesting LEDs using web servers. I want to teach you how to control these neopixels using TFT LCD, so that you can control and change their status in the shortest possible time. In this tutorial, you will have complete control just by touching the elements displayed on the screen.
